This is a 3d design of a Hbbillns type freight car for H0 model railroads. I provide the original AutoCAD file and stl-files which can be used to print on a 3d printer. I used a Prusa i3 MK3S printer which works very well.

In order to get a fully functional model you need:

- All stl files printed and assembled.
- Couplers to put into the [NEM norm receptacle](https://www.morop.eu/images/NEM_register/NEM_E/nem362_en_2004.pdf). I have used [Märklin Close Coupler Heads](https://www.maerklin.de/de/produkte/details/article/72000), but others will also work.
- Wheelset (2) with the following measures: ø 10,4 x 24,5 mm; also 11 x 25 mm works. I have used [Märklin wheelset 700150](https://www.maerklinshop.de/en/detail/index/sArticle/33206).
- Colors to paint the model.

Here is an image showing how to assemble the coupler:

The whole coupler can then be glued at the bottom at each side of the car.
