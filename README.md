This is a 3d design of a Hbbillns type freight car for H0 model railroads. I provide the original AutoCAD file and stl-files which can be used to print on a 3d printer. I used a Prusa i3 MK3S printer which works very well.

## Needed to assemble the model

In order to get a fully functional model you need:

- All stl files printed and assembled.
- Couplers to put into the [NEM norm receptacle](https://www.morop.eu/images/NEM_register/NEM_E/nem362_en_2004.pdf). I have used [Märklin Close Coupler Heads](https://www.maerklin.de/de/produkte/details/article/72000), but others will also work.
- Wheelset (2) with the following measures: ø 10,4 x 24,5 mm; also 11 x 25 mm works. I have used [Märklin wheelset 700150](https://www.maerklinshop.de/en/detail/index/sArticle/33206).
- Colors to paint the model.

## Assembling instructions

Assembling should be more or less self-explaining. "_Aufbau.stl" is the car body which can be plugged into the chassis ("_Boden.stl"). The buffers ("_Puffer_dickkurz.stl") are also glued at the respecting locations on both sides of the car. The coupler part consists of for separate files. Here is an image showing how to assemble the coupler:

The whole coupler can then be glued at the bottom at each side of the car. Of course part "Kupplung_1a.stl" (the middle one) must not be glued but is a moving part. Part "Kupplung_1b.stl" is a small plate that must be glued on top of "Kupplung_1a.stl" to hold the coupler head. I have separated this part only for printing purposes because then no supports are needed inside the receptacle.

It is also advised to separate the roof part of the car body ("Aufbau_v3.stl") from the rest in order to avoid too many printing supports.
